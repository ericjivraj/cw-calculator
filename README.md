# Coursework Calculator

This project is a calculator for the expected return date of feedback on your coursework by the university. The policy for the university states that all coursework receive feedback within 4 weeks after the submission date, however this does not include weekends, holidays, non-term time dates, etc... This project was requested by the university whilst I was working as a student experience champion (during 2nd year of uni).
